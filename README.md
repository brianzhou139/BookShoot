BookShoot is a book review and recommendation app.Users can take a picture of a book of interests in a store/library e.t.c  and then instantly read feedback on it or recommendations for similar book from Goodreads, Amazon, and other similar platforms

## Edufree Team
It consists of 1 team member : Brian Zhou as the UIUX designer and coder (https://github.com/brianzhou139).I came up with the idea after facing the same problem each of not knowing which book to purchase/read and what do others really say about this book.I started from scratch and used Google books,good reads, new york times and APIS for data collection.
